This is a project to build deep learning models and error correction models using NARX neural networks.
NARX neural network is a kind of nonlinear autoregressive neural network with external input. 
Due to its cyclic feedback structure and delay line structure, it is very suitable for the construction of rainfall runoff prediction model. 
Therefore, this project constructs a set of prediction and correction model based on NARX neural network. 
The project is mainly divided into model training and model use (this part is the real prediction or test set).
